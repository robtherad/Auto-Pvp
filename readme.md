### Info
A two team PVP mission that automatically generates a fight-night style battlefield for you. Two teams will be placed in random locations and fight for control over a sector in the center of the battlefield. 

### Mission Parameters
* Mission time limit (Choices every 5 minutes from 5 to 90 minutes)
* Cumulative time to capture the sector (Choices every 5 minutes from 5 to 90 minutes)
* Battlefield radius (Choices every 100 meters from 100m to a 1000m meter radius)
* Show other team's starting location to: (Choose between neither team, one of either team, or both teams)

### Future Goals

* Allow creation of Attack/Defense missions.
* Option to provide a side objective (Destroy cache, destroy static vehicle, destroy tower, second cap point, etc)
* Option to allow assets (HMG Pickup Trucks, HMMVs, Transport Trucks, Littlebirds, etc)
* Allow admin to re-roll starting positions through briefing option?
* Automatically save the randomly generated mission parameters of the last mission on the server to allow for replaying of the same mission without being insanely lucky.

### Known Problems
* There's a chance that one or both teams could get a start zone with no land route to the central objective. In this case, the mission would need to be restarted.
