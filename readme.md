### Process
1. Choose a random point on the map based on the size of the map (will have to manually get sizes for all CUP maps)
* Using the number of players, scale the area of play and mission time limit
* Pick starting locations for both teams. Need to not be in sight of each other and should at least be three quarters of the distance to the objective away from each other.

### Info
Type:   2 Team PvP
Objective:  Sector / Eliminate

tl;dr - A redone DTAS better suited to playing Fight Night style missions without having to make new missions every week

### Parameter Ideas

* AO Size Modifier:   Small (50%), Normal (100%), Large (150%)
* Time Limits:    Very Short (50%), Short (75%), Normal (100%), Long (125%), Very Long (150%)
* Show Enemy Starting Zones to:   Everybody, Nobody, OPFOR Only, BLUFOR Only

### Future Goals

* Allow creation of Attack/Defense missions.
* Option to provide a side objective (Destroy cache, destroy static vehicle, destroy tower, second cap point, etc)
* Option to allow assets (HMG Pickup Trucks, HMMVs, Transport Trucks, Littlebirds, etc)
* Allow admin to re-roll starting positions through briefing option?
* Automatically save the randomly generated mission parameters of the last mission on the server to allow for replaying of the same mission without being insanely lucky.

### Known Problems
* There's a chance that one or both teams could get a start zone with no land route to the central objective. In this case, the mission would need to be restarted.
