### Info
Type:   2 Team PvP
Objective:  Sector / Eliminate

tl;dr - A mission that automatically creates and sets up a fight night style mission in a random position of the map.

### Future Goals

* Allow creation of Attack/Defense missions.
* Option to provide a side objective (Destroy cache, destroy static vehicle, destroy tower, second cap point, etc)
* Option to allow assets (HMG Pickup Trucks, HMMVs, Transport Trucks, Littlebirds, etc)
* Allow admin to re-roll starting positions through briefing option?
* Automatically save the randomly generated mission parameters of the last mission on the server to allow for replaying of the same mission without being insanely lucky.

### Known Problems
* There's a chance that one or both teams could get a start zone with no land route to the central objective. In this case, the mission would need to be restarted.
